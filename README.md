# Computational Neuronal Models of Entrainment, Synchronization, and Oscillations

Examples by Matthew Stroud ---
Thanks to Tyler Banks, Ben Latimer, Pete Canfield, and Satish Nair for assisting in the creation of these models.

These examples were inspired by examples in Christophe Borgers' book, "Introduction to Modeling Neuronal Dynamics".
Each example in this repository is written in Python and may use the packages NEURON and or BMTK. 
Some features of the original examples are ignored while implementing similar networks in these models..

The goal of these computational models is to display general network features and their affects apart from raw numerical solutions when possible.
